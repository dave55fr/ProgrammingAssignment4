# Getting-and-Cleaning-Data-Week-4-Assignment

The purpose of this repository is complete the assignment during Week 4 for the Coursera Data Science Track course Getting & Cleaning Data 

## Overview

The purpose of this project is to demonstrate the ability to collect, work with, and clean a data set. The goal is to prepare tidy data that can be used for later analysis. A full description of the data used in this project can be found at 'The UCI Machine Learning Repository'(http://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/Human+Activity+Recognition+Using+Smartphones)

The source data for this project can be found here.(https://d396qusza40orc.cloudfront.net/getdata%2Fprojectfiles%2FUCI%20HAR%20Dataset.zip)

## Work
The aim of the project is to create a R script named run_analysis.R doing the following.

1. Merges the training and the test sets to create one data set.
2. Extracts only the measurements on the mean and standard deviation for each measurement.
3. Uses descriptive activity names to name the activities in the data set
4. Appropriately labels the data set with descriptive variable names.
5. From the data set in step 4, creates a second, independent tidy data set with the average of each variable for each activity and each subject.

## Files
The following files are provided.

1. 'CodeBook.MD' contains information on the variables, data set, transformations and work that was done to tidy up the data

2. 'run_analysis.R' is the code for the R script used to complete the project goals

3. 'FinalTidyData.txt' is the output from the 'runAnalysis.R' R script
